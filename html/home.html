It is a club-management platform as well as a vast communication platform where a club can be able to communicate to all clubs which have accounts in the website.

		<p class="tex-bold" ><b>I-club &nbsp </b> provides a good club-management system for your club and an efficient communication platform. It enables club members to raise money to host a competition or invest and the money gotten from the activity be shared to each member according to the ratio of contributions of each member. Each memberâ€™s profile shall always be updated after every activity, so that when the member is done with school, it shall project all the activities the member participated in and the money the member owes the club and this money can then be withdrawn and be given to the member so that the member can now invest in a startup business. It is a very handy website when it comes to communication; if a club wants to host a competition, it simply sends invite to clubs which will participate and even when the club wants to host a big competition then the club can post to public and any club in the country that would want to participate shall simply accept the invite. The website comes with a calendar that shall be showing you the events you have accepted to participate in.</p>
